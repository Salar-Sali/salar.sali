  "As a mechatronic engineer with a passion for programming languages and natural languages, I bring a unique blend of technical and creative skills to my work as a frontend developer. With fluency in four languages - Kurdish, Arabic, English, and Russian - I have a strong foundation in communication and understanding diverse cultures. My focus on frontend development stems from my love of programming and graphic design. I enjoy the challenge of creating beautiful, responsive pages that deliver a seamless user experience. With experience working in multinational companies, I bring a wealth of knowledge in collaborating with teams from diverse backgrounds. My expertise in technologies such as React, TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit allows me to create high-quality, efficient code that brings my designs to life. Whether collaborating with teams or working independently, I am always dedicated to producing work that meets the highest standards of quality and user experience.";
